# 🧠 AI Impact on Job Market (2024–2030)

## 📋 Overview  
This project explores how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is expected to shape the job market between **2024 and 2030**.  
Using Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA), the study examines **automation risks, salary trends, and job growth projections** across various industries to understand which roles will evolve, grow, or decline in the AI era.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries  
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Data visualization and storytelling  
- **SciPy** – Statistical analysis  
- **Google Colab** – Cloud-based environment  
- **Dataset:** [AI Impact on Job Market Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahilislam007/ai-impact-on-job-market-20242030/data)

## 📊 Key Analysis Steps  
- Cleaned and standardized dataset (handled missing values, renamed columns)  
- Performed **descriptive statistics** and **outlier detection**  
- Conducted **univariate and bivariate analysis** to explore relationships between AI impact, automation risk, salary, and job growth  
- Created new analytical metrics:
  - `growth_change` = difference in job openings (2030 vs 2024)  
  - `growth_percent` = percentage change in job growth  
- Visualized data with:
  - Top 10 job roles  
  - Salary distribution by AI impact level  
  - Automation risk vs salary correlation  
  - Growth percentage distribution (2024 → 2030)

---

## 💡 Key Insights  
- Roles with **Low to Moderate AI impact** are projected to show **higher job growth** through 2030.  
- High-salary roles often face **moderate automation risk**, but remain valuable due to **specialized, high-skill demand**.  
- Skills such as **AI literacy, data analysis, and problem-solving** are likely to stay in demand.  
- Recommended focus for **freshers:** high-growth roles with adaptive, cross-domain skill sets that complement AI.

## 🎯 Outcome  
This project demonstrates the use of **Python-based data analysis** to uncover real-world insights from AI labor trends.  
It showcases skills in **EDA, visualization, statistical thinking, and storytelling** — translating complex data into clear, actionable findings about the **future of work**.
